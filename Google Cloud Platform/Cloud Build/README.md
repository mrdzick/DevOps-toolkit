# About Google Cloud Build
Google Cloud Build is used for CI/CD on Google Cloud Projects. Using this service, we can produce artifacts such as Docker Image and automatically push it to artifact registry when we push code changes to Git Repository.
We can customize which branch will trigger the build, the trigger can be set based on PR or push activity on Git Repository.
You can refer to [this documentation](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview).
