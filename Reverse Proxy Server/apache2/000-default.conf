# Set the port of listener. This will set proxy which listen on port 3000
<VirtualHost *:3000>
	# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
	# the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
	# redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
	# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
	# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
	# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
	# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
	ServerName localhost

	# ProxyPreserveHost: makes Apache pass the original Host header to the backend server.
	# This is useful, as it makes the backend server aware of the address used to access the application.
	ProxyPreserveHost On

	# ProxyPass: the main proxy configuration directive. In this case,
	# it specifies that everything under the root URL (/) should be mapped to the backend server
	# at the given address. For example, if Apache gets a request for /example, it will connect to
	# http://your_backend_server/example and return the response to the original client.
	ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/


	# ProxyPassReverse: should have the same configuration as ProxyPass.
	# It tells Apache to modify the response headers from the backend server.
	# This makes sure that if the backend server returns a location redirect header,
	# the clientâ€™s browser will be redirected to the proxy address and not the backend server address,
	# which would not work as intended.	
	ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/


	# Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
	# error, crit, alert, emerg.
	# It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
	# modules, e.g.
	#LogLevel info ssl:warn

	# For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
	# enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
	# include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
	# following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
	# after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
	#Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
